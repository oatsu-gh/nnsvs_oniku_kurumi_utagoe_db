## Output directory
# All the igenerated labels, intermediate files, and segmented wav files
# will be saved in the following directory
out_dir: "./data"

## f0 estimation limits
# Used in nnsvs-prepare-featurs.
# Change them with some margin from lowest f0 and higest f0 in DB.
# (kiritan: 150Hz/700Hz, oniku_kurumi: 150Hz/800Hz, Natsume_Singing_DB: 101Hz/587.33Hz)

## time unit of mono-phone label
# The time unit of mono-phone label is scheduled to be changed from sec to 100ns.

### Pyinsy related settings.
## Sinsy dictionary directory
# ONIKU_KURUMI_UTAGOE_DB contains the unvoiced vowels "I" and "U".
# To enable the unvoiced vowels, modified version of sinsy dictionary files
# are needed.

### Data preparation related settings.
## Song segmentation by silence durations.
# TODO: would be better to split songs by phrasal information in the musical scores
# Split song by silences (in sec)
segmentation_threshold: 0.6
# Min duration for a segment
# note: there could be some execptions (e.g., the last segment of a song)
segment_min_duration: 4.0
# Force split segments if long silence is found regardless of min_duration

# Offset correction
# If True, offset is computed in an entire song
# otherwise offset is computed for each segment
