### Data preparation related settings.
## Song segmentation by silence durations.
# TODO: would be better to split songs by phrasal information in the musical scores
# Split song by silences (in sec)
segmentation_threshold: 0.6
# Min duration for a segment
# note: there could be some execptions (e.g., the last segment of a song)

# Force split segments if long silence is found regardless of min_duration

# If True, offset is computed in an entire song
# otherwise offset is computed for each segment
